define("_TEXT2", "The PASPAL team consists of six students of the Secondary Technical School POJFM, which is located in Frýdek-Místek. Our team first met at the end of November 2020, when we agreed on who will do each part. We also dealt with a secondary mission. Work on the project takes place in meetings every week in mechatronics classrooms or online via Teams. From the beginning, we met online and we delt with management, websites and components for the secondary mission. You can follow our entire process here, on the website or on social networks, where we launch a competition for valuable prizes.");

define("_TEXT4", "CanSat is a small can meteorological satellite. This student competition is organized by the educational office of the European Space Agency ESERO. The team's task is to build an imitation of a real satellite that is the size of a can and should also act like a real satellite. All controling units, sensors up to batteries and power supply must fit in the size of can. The main goal is to analyze the measured data. Data will be sent to the ground station, where they will be evaluated and, if necessary, placed in the broader context of the entire mission. The satellite must also land safely in order to be used for further data analysis using an SD card. Finally, the teams must present the entire mission to an expert jury.");

define("_TEXT5", "We named our satellite ExoCan. As a primary mission, it must measure temperature, atmospheric pressure and GPS location. On our secondary mission, we prepared an examination of the living conditions of organisms. We will mainly measure gass substances, which we then analyze and put into tables. We compare the data with older data and find out how our atmosphere is changing. We will also measure methane, and compare it to older records that tell us how the oxygen expansion has increased or decreased. We also decided that our satellite will be very ecological, we will use natural resources. We figured out that we'd put a solar system around.");
